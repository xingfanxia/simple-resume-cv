\textbf{Building the next-gen storage infrastructure for large-scale distributed systems with billions of rows and terabytes of data, improving the performance of AIML and other big data analytics applications.}
\SubBulletItem \textbf{Tech Stack: Java, Python, Spark, Iceberg, AWS Services(S3, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Cloudwatch, etc.)}
\SubBulletItem
Implemented CTAS(Create Table As Select) feature for Iceberg Tables in Athena query engine. Released Iceberg Table GA Preview RE:INVENT 2022 and millions of CTAS queries being executed since the release.
\SubBulletItem
Overhauled the existing Hive JSON Serde library, improved the query execution performance by up to 30\%, and mitigated type casting compatibility issues.
\SubBulletItem
Implemented a virtualized table connector on top of the Iceberg table connector so users can leverage the performance of the Iceberg table engine to access other table formats with limited scalability. 
Improved the query execution speed of these table formats by approximately 40\%, avoided congestion, and is projected to save 4 million in hardware costs per year.
\SubBulletItem
Worked on a cross-team endeavor to overhaul the query routing logic from the Athena engine to multiple external services, reduced excessive retry behaviors, and reduced service congestion by up to 32\%

\SubBulletItem \textbf{Tech Stack: Python, Objective-C, Sklearn Kit, Pytorch, Airflow, Hive, Presto, Spark}
\SubBulletItem
Implemented an on-device user profiling framework that consists of several models to predict users' overall interest and preferences as an upstream service that provides signals to downstream consumers like Apple Map, and Apple News.
\SubBulletItem
Improved the on-device location model with 4 times of training data and better engineered aggregated features, increased user engagement rate by 9\%.
\SubBulletItem
Overhauled the topic prediction model leveraging transformer-based model BERT, increased topic prediction accuracy by 14\% and user engagement rate by 11\%.
\SubBulletItem
Developed an automatic machine learning pipeline that retrains models with data source updates, launches A/B testing experiments, and deploys new models if a specified improvement is observed, saving engineering hours across the team.
\SubBulletItem
Worked on action prediction service which predicts user intention at a particular time and location by aggregating various signals from multiple models input which is used in Siri Suggestions and Siri Shortcuts.

\textbf{Fighting financial fraud with machine learning models and rule-based engine.}
\SubBulletItem \textbf{Tech Stack: Python, Java, Scala, Sklearn Kit, Airflow, Hive, Presto, Spark}
\SubBulletItem
Developed a machine learning model to tackle the fake review problem at Airbnb with Sklearn and Pandas, cutting the volume of fake reviews to 1\% of the peak volume and preventing 2 million losses.
\SubBulletItem
Trained a machine learning model to produce a comprehensive risk score with Sklearn and Pandas, evaluating the overall risk of users on Airbnb, especially on Airbnb hosts, similar to Alipay's Zhima/Seasame score.
\SubBulletItem
Collaborated with team to launch the delayed payout policy which delays the payout of risky Airbnb hosts, prevented 60\% of fraudulent payouts being made and hence in an estimated 10 million in annual savings.
\SubBulletItem
Built a java microservice that provides downstream services with consolidated risk signals using Redis, Hive, and Kafka.
\SubBulletItem
Designed and Implemented a scoring java service that produces risk scores of certain events and scenarios supporting multiple downstream consumers using Redis, Hive, and Kafka.
